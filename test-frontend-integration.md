# Test Frontend Integration

## Steps to Test Electron UI

1. **Verify Data Fetching**
   - Open the Electron application.
   - Navigate to the relevant section where data should be displayed.
   - Ensure data is correctly fetched from the backend and displayed.

2. **Check User Actions**
   - Perform actions such as adding, updating, and deleting items.
   - Verify that these actions trigger the appropriate backend calls.
   - Ensure the UI updates accordingly based on the backend response.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Simulate backend errors (e.g., by shutting down the backend server).
   - Verify that the UI handles errors gracefully and displays appropriate messages.
